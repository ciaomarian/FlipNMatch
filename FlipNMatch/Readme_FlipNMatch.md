# Flip and Match Game

This game was built as a Udacity Front End Dev. course project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as learned in class. I studied two additional Udacity courses; Object-Oriented Javascript, and React for more information and understanding about how best to code this project.
#### Game sequence:
	 * Player can choose between 3 deck levels with 12, 16 and 24 hards each.
	 * A timer displays play time and total minutes taken to complete matches.
	 * There is an initial 3 star rating which drops as more time and moves are taken.
#### On each turn:
	 * The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
	 * Then turns over a second card, trying to find a matching card.
	 * If a match, both cards stay flipped.
	 * If the cards do not match, cards are flipped back to hide unmatched symbols.
 *  * The game ends once all cards have been matched. *  * 
	 *  * A pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final star rating and a restart button. *  * 
#### Resources used to research and/or create the game:

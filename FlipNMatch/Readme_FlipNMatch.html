			<p class="H1">Flip and Match Game</p>
			<p class="p">This game was built as a Udacity Front End Dev. course project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as learned in class. I studied an additional Udacity Object-Oriented Javascript, and also a React course for more information and understanding about how best to code this project.</p>
			<p class="h4">Game sequence:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="ul">Player can choose between 3 deck levels with 12, 16 and 24 hards each.</li>
				<li class="ul">A timer displays play time and total minutes taken to complete matches.</li>
				<li class="ul">There is an initial 3 star rating which drops as more time and moves are taken.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h4">On each turn:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="ul">The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol</li>
				<li class="ul">Then turns over a second card, trying to find a matching card.</li>
				<li class="ul">If a match, both cards stay flipped.</li>
				<li class="ul">If the cards do not match, cards are flipped back to hide symbol.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="p">The game ends once all cards have been matched.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="ul">A pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final star rating and a restart button.</li>
			</ul>

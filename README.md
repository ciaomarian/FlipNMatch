# Flip and Match Game

I built this game as a Udacity Front End Dev. course project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as learned in class. I studied an additional Udacity Object-Oriented Javascript, and also a React course for more information and understanding about how best to code this project.
#### Game sequence:
	*Player can choose between 3 deck levels with 12, 16 and 24 cards each.
	*A timer displays play time and total minutes taken to complete matches.
	*There is an initial 3 star rating which drops as more time and moves are taken.
#### On each turn:
	*The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
	*Then turns over a second card, trying to find a matching card.
	*If a match, both cards stay flipped.
	*If the cards do not match, cards are flipped back to hide unmatched symbols.
**The game ends once all cards have been matched.**
	**A pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final star rating and a restart button.**

	 * Udacity Forums, Udacity Git Hubs, MDN, CSS Tricks, Scotch, Kahn Academy, and Python Tutor.
	 * My Udacity Mentor, Mofid, and my Udacity Project Reviewer.
